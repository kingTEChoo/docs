**Pages as the root unit of a source**

_<u>Key Points</u>_

- **why:** absorbed from the page-level choice, "sourcing" comes as a payload in the form of a page - img_url (link to the exact page), page_number, and the parsed text. this can be used standalone to get the search candidates and/or for LMs to run inference over by passing text through to the LM.
- **thought to add:** "sourcing" needs to balance between LM understanidng and importantly human interpretability. naturally as analysts are used to reading directly from PDFs rather than the parsed text of PDFs, that is also the way we give to LMs so that downstream generations can always be default in a format that is 'easy to interpret'
- **add a guide:** how to source with LMs \+ the Retrieval system
