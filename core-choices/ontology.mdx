Key points:

- **why:** our classification is intentional in order to flatten the universe of equity data so that: (1) data itself is comparable in \+ between equities; (2) interpretable by humans and LMs; (3) measure completeness of data
- **note about today: **different players have different classifications mainly because a lot of the 'useful' information is scattered on IR websites (with different ranges of frequency per equity)
