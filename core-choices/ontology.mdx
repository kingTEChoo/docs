title: "Ontology"

**Key points:**

- **why:** our classification is intentional in order to flatten the universe of equity data so that: (1) data itself is comparable in \+ between equities; (2) interpretable by humans and LMs; (3) measure completeness of data
- **ultimately: **ontology allows for the flexibility to compose sets (slices) within data whether that is comparable cross-time and/or cross-equity and/or cross-event and/or cross-content which enables the possibility of more types of analysis
- **note about today:** different players have different classifications mainly because a lot of the 'useful' information is scattered on IR websites (with different ranges of frequency per equity)
