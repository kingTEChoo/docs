- You can acccess / declare the tools from provider-\>method level directly
- transform.py 

every tool has a

- `tool_name`
- `tool_description`
- `tool_provider`
- `tool_category`
- `tool_input_model`
- `tool_output_model`

categories

- companies

response

The way tools are interfaced (need to be able to specify this better)

- code
- ...

1. start from the provider
2. then spec out the tools that would be helpful
3. then after think about the i/o definitions and descriptions
4. also think about whether there is extra handling we need and if that is sorted out by other tool provisions i.e. runtime processing or preprocessing
4. and then think about categories for each tool

There can be many tools from one `tool_provider` that sits within multiple categories. We can start mapping things out from the pov that there can be many tools. APIs will not come as a format by which it is usable by default.

Maybe we need a tools explorer locally, not live
