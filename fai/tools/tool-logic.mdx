title: "Tool Logic"
---

Overall

- There are definitely company specific information (documents / financials) that is one segmentation
- Think we should try to expose all of the API endpoints as raw as possible(?). That we we truly integrate once and then after we can transform it.
- It's also because it's not 100% obvious that all tools must become providers or something
- This neesd to be a process that we 'don't' have to place that much cognitive bandwidth and more on testing.

Open Qs:

- Do we want to do -\> 'OutputClass' so that we can utilise it? again?
