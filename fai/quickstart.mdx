### Starting

Navigating to your a repo and/or create a new repo. Then set up your virtual environment and initialise it.

`source .venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

### Installing

`uv pip install "git+ssh://git@github.com/wissenai/fai.git[all]"`

You can check the releases [here](https://github.com/wissenai/fai) and use `fai --version` to see if it's updated with the latest

### Creating

You want to get the collection of `.env` variables locally first and then in the terminal run (this will make available keys you need e.g. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY` to create DB and allow for generations to run

```
set -a
source .env
set +a
```

This will create a `/<instance-name>` folder and also set-up your cloudflare D1 database and r2 blob storage\
`fai create <instance-name> --storage cloudflare`

Later, `<storage_provider>` can be set-up to be more flexible i.e. at initialisation, we add more flexibilities around this\
`fai create <instance-name> --storage <storage_provider>`

[IDEA: ADD TEMPLATES TO MAKE SET-UP EASIER] `<templates>`

### Running

Make sure you're inside the folder\
`cd <instance-name>`

You can then use the following command(s) to either store runs locally, in dev table or in prod table.

To run locally and store locally

`fai run gen <gen_type> <input_model> --env local`

To run locally and store in `dev` table

`fai run gen <gen_type> <input_model> --env dev`

To run locally and store in `prod` table

`fai run gen <gen_type> <input_model> --env prod`

Running a generation flow

`fai run flow <flow_name> <input_model> --env <local|dev|prod>`

### Deploying

`fai deploy <instance-name> --runtime modal -m "<deployment_message>"`

### Upgrading

To get the latest version of the fai package\
`uv pip install "git+ssh://git@github.com/wissenai/fai.git[all]"`

You would then also need to redeploy the instance\
`fai deploy <instance-name> --runtime modal -m "<deployment_message>"`

<u>[TO BE ADDED SOON]</u>\
If you wanted to upgrade the current version to be compatible with the latest version of the package (incase schema changes etc.)\
`fai upgrade <instance-name>`

### Deleting

<u>[TO BE ADDED SOON]</u>\
If you wanted to delete the entire project (databases, live runtime and overall project)\
`fai delete <instance-name>`\
Note: you will need to confirm `<instance-name>`
