### Starting

Navigating to your a repo and/or create a new repo. Then set up your virtual environment and initialise it.

Create a virtual environment

`uv venv`

Activate the virtual environment

`source .venv/bin/activate`

### Installing

`uv pip install "git+ssh://git@github.com/wissenai/fai.git[all]"`

You can check the releases [here](https://github.com/wissenai/fai) and use `fai --version` to see if it's updated with the latest

### Creating

You want to get the collection of `.env` variables locally first and then in the terminal run (this will make available keys you need e.g. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY` to create DB and allow for generations to run

```
set -a
source .env
set +a
```

This will create a `/<instance-name>` folder and also set-up your cloudflare D1 database and r2 blob storage\
`fai create <instance-name> --storage cloudflare`

Later, `<storage_provider>` can be set-up to be more flexible i.e. at initialisation, we add more flexibilities around this\
`fai create <instance-name> --storage <storage_provider>`

<u>[IDEA: ADD TEMPLATES TO MAKE SET-UP EASIER] </u>`--template <templates>`

### Running & Storing

Make sure you're inside the folder\
`cd <instance-name>`

You can then use the following command(s) to either store runs locally, in dev table or in prod table.

To run locally and store locally. (Note: this will be in your `/<instance-name>/data/fai.db` folder. (You should download the SQLite Viewer extension to view the table).

`fai run gen <gen_type> <input_model> --env local`

To run locally and store in `dev` table. (Note: this will be in the D1 Cloudflare Dashboard).

`fai run gen <gen_type> <input_model> --env dev`

To run locally and store in `prod` table. (Note: this will be in the D1 Cloudflare Dashboard).

`fai run gen <gen_type> <input_model> --env prod`

Running a generation flow

`fai run flow <flow_name> <input_model> --env <local|dev|prod>`

<u>[needs a better explanation wrt to HTTPie style inputs on CLI]</u>

### Declaring

**<u>[TO ADD - CONSIDER IF IT SHOULD BE SEPERATE]</u>**

there should just be a note on what the changes are to the current code (i.e. make sure it's dependent) so that it's super clear

### Testing

Before deployment, you can run an automated test:\
`fai test <instance-name>`

```expandable
> Testing FAI instance: my-research

1. Loading declaration...
   - Loaded declare.py
   - Found FAIInstance: my-research ✅

2. Validating evals...
   - thoroughness ✅
   - consistency ✅

3. Validating generations...
   - foundational_understanding ✅
   - revenue_analysis ✅
   - general_analysis ✅

4. Validating flows...
   - CompanyInitiation ✅ (steps: 5)

5. Checking prompts...
   - prompts/foundational_understanding.md ✅
   - prompts/revenue_analysis.md ✅
   - prompts/general_analysis.md ✅

All Checks Passed ✅
```

### Deploying

`fai deploy <instance-name> --runtime modal -m "<deployment_message>"`

You can think of `deployment_message` as like the git commit message.

At a later date, `<runtime_engine>` can determined.

`fai deploy <instance-name> --runtime <runtime_engine>`

### Upgrading

To get the latest version of the fai package\
`uv pip install "git+ssh://git@github.com/wissenai/fai.git[all]"`

You would then also need to redeploy the instance\
`fai deploy <instance-name> --runtime modal -m "<deployment_message>"`

<u>[TO BE ADDED SOON]</u>\
If you wanted to upgrade the current version to be compatible with the latest version of the package (incase schema changes etc.). This should include any details about the upgrade and what is expected to happen. Some ways of systematically handling that would be helpful.\
`fai upgrade <instance-name>`

### Deleting

<u>[TO BE ADDED SOON]</u>\
If you wanted to delete the entire project (databases, live runtime and overall project)\
`fai delete <instance-name>`\
Note: you will need to confirm `<instance-name>`

Other misc actions

- Observing
  - this ideally should actually be logically seperated so that it's easy to create diagnosis loops e.g. read [declare.py](http://declare.py) and then i.e. check on logfire -\> \<instance-name\> -\> \<gen_type\> and you'll be able to see what the problems were
  - we should also add better tagging etc. so that it's easy for query when we need it at some point 
  - set-up dashboards as well where possible so that we can monitor things from the get go
- Declaring
- Reading
- Testing
- List e.g. fai list templates - something like that where we can easily store things that are helpful in terms of data for when building.
- Downloading Specific Version
  - If wanted to use a specific version
