**Overview**

[Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) is produced by [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) as their observability product. We currently use this as our primary observability platform from generations to storage. Each `<instance-name>` when created will have an associated `instance-name` created inside of logfire.

**Plan**

We're on their <u>free plan</u> currently and doesn't seem like we actually need anything more than that.

**How to access the logs for instance name**

Go to https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/ and log-in.

Once you have created an `<instance-name>` (see [quickstart](/fai/quickstart)), you will be able to see the logs as per below.
