**File Reference**

`fai/src/fai/storage/schema.py`in `DEPLOYMENTS_SCHEMA`

**Schema**

`deployment_id`: this is the unique identifier for the deployment

```
1db5cd58-8447-4ea8-9d30-8b806d20b307
```

`instance_name`: this is the instance-name of the project

```
test-4
```

`env`: the deployment environment

[this should either be removed or we have a way to actually deploy seperate endpoints]

```
dev
```

`git_commit`: this is the commit hash that the current deployment is on (useful for finding the state of the code when this deployment was made)

```
a858da6
```

`message`: this is the `<deployment_message>`that was created to commentate on changes

```
deployment to modal
```

`created_at`: this is when that specific deployment was created

```
2025-12-18T18:58:33.016302
```

`is_active`: this is whether the deployment is active or not on modal.

[this should probably be removed - don't really see the purpose]

```
0
```

`metadata`: this is the metadata of the deployment e.g. file path and also deployment endpoint]

[not 100% clear what is this helpful for]

```
{"path": "/Users/kingtongchoo/Desktop/coding/embed/test-4", "runtime": "modal", "endpoint_url": "https://wissen-ai--fai-test-4-api.modal.run"}
```

[others to add]

- diffs: changes from one version to another (some script that will check what has changed / been added / removed)
