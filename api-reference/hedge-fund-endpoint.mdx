description: "Overview of the hedge fund endpoint and its core features"
---

Our hedge fund endpoint provides flexible access to financial documents and derived data. This page outlines the main functionality and how the pieces fit together. Request and response formats are still being finalized, so placeholders are included where more detail is needed.

## Core Features

### Data & Ontology
- **Classification pipeline:** all documents are processed through our proprietary ontology. This flattens different reporting styles so that comparable data can be accessed consistently.
- **Composable datasets:** users can combine different slices of data (cross-time, cross-equity, or cross-event) to conduct analysis.
- **Current data sources:** information typically obtained from S&P and other providers will be available once passed through our classification algorithm.

### LM Readable Data
- **Document delivery:** every page can be returned as an image or as parsed text. This allows large language models to work with whichever representation best fits the context window.
- **Page granularity:** we keep information at the page level so that references remain human interpretable while still being LM friendly.

### Retrieval Service
- **Filtering:** queries can be filtered using the ontology (for example by event, content type, or equity ticker). This narrows the universe before search begins.
- **Multimodal search:** search considers text, figures, and tables together to find the most relevant pages.
- **Known sets:** the service can prioritize documents that are already known to the user to further improve relevance.

### Page-Level Search and Sourcing
- We intentionally chose page-level search to balance semantic preservation with simple attribution. LMs and human analysts can both reference pages directly from the returned results.

## API Overview

The actual endpoints are still under design. A typical request is expected to include authentication, filter parameters and a query string. A high level example of the request/response shape is shown below.

```json
{
  "endpoint": "/v1/search", // [TO FILL WITH ENDPOINT PATH]
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" },
  "body": {
    "query": "<natural language query>",
    "filters": { /* [TO FILL WITH FILTER EXAMPLES] */ }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "page_number": 12,
      "img_url": "https://.../page12.png",
      "text": "...parsed page text...",
      "source": "<pdf name or id>"
    }
    /* more results */
  ],
  "benchmark": {
    "latency_ms": "[TO FILL WITH LATENCY]",
    "precision": "[TO FILL WITH PRECISION]",
    "recall": "[TO FILL WITH RECALL]"
  }
}
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks will be published regularly to provide assurances on latency and search quality. See [Benchmarking Overview](/benchmarking/quick-overview) for the methodology.

## Next Steps

- Finalize endpoint definitions, including authentication and request/response schemas.
- Provide sample code snippets demonstrating typical queries.
- Expand benchmarking results with datasets relevant to hedge fund workflows.
