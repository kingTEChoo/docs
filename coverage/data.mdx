title: "Data Coverage"
description: "Data coverage is a very broadly defined term especially when there is a wide array of data that is not regulatory yet important. Below is a categorisation of the data that we currently track"

**Key Points:**

- **split: **there are two dimensions:
  - event depth: how many different types of events do we cover e.g. fiscal_event (what is in that) and also conference data
  - time depth: how many years (fiscal or published) do we cover for the equities that are supported
- **add a note: **add a note that we aim to get data with [NN]% reliability and <u>provide data that the company produces, meaning if companies don't support some data, then we naturally wont' have it available</u>
- **add a note: **that if we do not provide the data that is required, then please contact us to extend that. we prioritise source by source-basis .
