Key points

- **natural language queries:** you would input natural language query into here and by default it will conduct a multimodal search.
  - **add note on filtering:** if you do not filter, then it will consider all of the sets of candidates which is suboptimal
  - **add note on fts:** it is by default curretnly multimodal search and later we can offer more options e.g. search_type=multimodal OR search_type=fts OR search_type=hybrid
- **advice:** add some advice on best ways to maximise performance here on the search results e.g. query processor and/or shapes of queries that gets highest hits
