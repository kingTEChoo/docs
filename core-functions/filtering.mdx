Key points

- **Filters:**
  - **time filter:** you can filter by time by fiscal year (asserted by the company), fiscal quarter, published date, fiscal date
  - **content filter:** you can filter by content type(s) e.g. annual_report_regulatory, earnings_transcript, etc. (there needs to be some mapping)
  - **event filter**: you can filter at event levels e.g. fiscal events or conference presentations to have search over events rather than an array of filters
- **Intention:**
  - The intention of filters pre-searching, you there are some queries that are typically found in specific documents. If this is known ahead of search, you'll find much better results
  - The ontology/classification is tuned to 'flatten' out data across equities to allow for ease of pulling the 'same' data from different equities regardless of geography, reporting prefereneces, and info produced (non-regulatory filings)
- **Implementation:**
  - An example of how filtering can be stacked into the JSON query to the endpoint and then somehow relate to the specific API documentation
