Key points

- **time filter:** you can filter by time by fiscal year (asserted by the company), fiscal quarter, published date, fiscal date
- **content filter:** you can filter by content type(s) e.g. annual_report_regulatory, earnings_transcript, etc. (there needs to be some mapping)
- **event filter**: you can filter at event levels e.g. fiscal events or conference presentations to have search over events rather than an array of filters
