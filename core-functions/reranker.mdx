**Key points:**

- **When:** you typically want to use a reranker when the initial candidates considered is very large as such you need to post-filter the quries
- **What:** we have a [xx] reranker that will allow the user to filter the results for better search performances
- **How:** they need to specify use_reranker: True and then specify the rerank_k to give us the number that they want to come back.
