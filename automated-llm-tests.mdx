adding devleopment as well

[concept] probably raises the priority of this so that i can let it cook for longer rather than

Whenever LLMs runs a release. The LLM is able to then:

check if the gh workflows if successful

if successful then, it'll download the package via

`uv pip install "git+ssh://git@github.com/wissenai/fai.git[all]"`

Then it'll run fai create `testing-instance`

run the tests to make sure things are working as expected

if everything passes and as expected

it'll then run `fai delete testing-instance`

this way we achieve as close to agent autonomy. there is probably places in the workflow where it needs to have tools to read logs e.g.

- d1/r2 (database/blob storage)
- logfire (observability), reading
- modal (runtime engine)

- we probably also want to add the full template of things that we want to test which is a function of the given instantiation
- human still needs to understand what is happening
- we still manual testing in any instance to ensure any new behaviours works. we cannot vibe code this in.
